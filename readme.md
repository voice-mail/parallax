# Parallax Image Viewer
By Voicemail

### How to use
1. Make equally sized parallax images and save them as a png. **You must name each layer by number** in order from front to back, starting with 1. An example set of images is provided in the repository.
2. Configure the scroll speed and parallax multiplier in **conf.lua**.
3. Run the file either by typing "love ." in the console, or by pressing alt + l if you have the love vscode extension.
4. Edit the layers you copied into the program directory, and they will instantly update in the program.
